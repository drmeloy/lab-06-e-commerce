            Good Instruments was founded on the idea that good is good.<br><br>Who needs the best, when anyone can have good?<br><br>We like good food, we like good company, we like good drink, and we like good instruments.<br><br><em>Good instruments,<br>when good is good.</em>

                <p>
                    Here at Good Instruments, we were raised on the belief that your instrument shouldn't just be "ok", it should be <em>good</em>.<br><br>Here on our site you'll find a small to moderate sized collection of instruments that we deem "good". So what're you waiting for? Go ahead and navigate to "SHOP" above to begin shopping!
